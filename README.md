#  IoT Communication Model ‚Äì Device Connectivity Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of an IoT communication model for connecting physical devices and enabling remote monitoring and control. It was developed as part of a CPS Lab experiment at Visvodaya Engineering College.

---

##  Project Overview

The Internet of Things (IoT) enables seamless communication between devices, services, and people across any network, at any time, and from any place. This model focuses on **bi-directional communication** between IoT devices and remote user interfaces. The system supports real-time sensor monitoring (temperature and humidity) and actuator control (bulb on/off).

---

##  Objective

**To build a working IoT communication model for connecting and controlling hardware devices remotely.**

---

##  Hardware Components

- Raspberry Pi (with SD card)
- DHT11 Sensor (Temperature & Humidity)
- Relay Module
- Bulb
- Jumper Wires
- Power Adapter

---

##  Software & Tools Used

- Raspberry Pi Imager
- PuTTY (SSH access)
- VNC Viewer (remote desktop)
- RaspController (Android mobile app)
- Custom C program for UART communication (`sp.c`)
- Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)

---

## Communication Technologies Involved

- Wi-Fi (primary connectivity)
- VNC over TCP/IP
- UART (serial communication on embedded devices)
- SSH (remote terminal access)

---

##  Description

This IoT setup uses a Raspberry Pi configured with:
- Remote access via SSH and VNC
- Integration with a DHT11 sensor to read temperature and humidity values
- Relay control to switch a bulb ON/OFF remotely
- Mobile access via RaspController

The communication model maintains a persistent bi-directional connection between the client (user or device) and the Raspberry Pi server. The server remains active, logging all open sessions and responding to user commands.

---

##  Setup Procedure (Step-by-Step)

1. **SD Card Preparation**
   - Use Raspberry Pi Imager to install Raspberry Pi OS on a 16GB SD card.
   - Set hostname, enable SSH, configure Wi-Fi (SSID: `IOTLAB`, password: `IOTLAB@123`), and create user credentials.

2. **Boot & Access**
   - Insert SD card into Raspberry Pi.
   - Access via PuTTY using the IP address (e.g., `192.168.243.6`).
   - Run `sudo raspi-config` to enable VNC.

3. **Desktop Access**
   - Open VNC Viewer on your desktop.
   - Connect using the IP address and login credentials.

4. **Mobile Access**
   - Install RaspController on your smartphone.
   - Add the Raspberry Pi device and login.
   - Use the app to read DHT11 sensor data and control the bulb.

5. **Circuit Connection**
   - Connect DHT11 sensor to GPIO pins.
   - Connect relay module to control a bulb.
   - Use RaspController or the desktop dashboard to test functionality.

## ‚öô UART Communication (`sp.c`)

This embedded C program configures UART0 for serial communication between microcontroller modules.

### Functions Included:

- `initClocks()` ‚Äì Configures system clocks and PLL
- `initUART0()` ‚Äì Initializes UART0 at 9600 baud
- `U0Write()` ‚Äì Sends a byte over UART
- `Send_String()` ‚Äì Sends a complete string over UART

This is designed for microcontroller-to-microcontroller or sensor module communication.

---

##  Output

- Temperature and humidity readings shown in mobile/desktop dashboard.
- Bulb toggles on/off based on user input.
- Full control and monitoring using either a desktop or mobile interface.

---

##  Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates an **IoT communication system** that allows remote bi-directional interaction with connected devices using real-time sensor feedback and actuator control.
